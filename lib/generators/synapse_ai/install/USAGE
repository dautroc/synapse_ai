Description:
    This generator creates the SynapseAI initializer file at config/initializers/synapse_ai.rb.

Example:
    rails generate synapse_ai:install

This will create a file where you can configure your API keys and other SynapseAI settings.
Make sure to set your API keys (e.g., ENV['OPENAI_API_KEY']) in your application's
environment or Rails credentials.
